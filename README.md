# jobbies

A job bot for Slack (yes okay I'm just experimenting here but this might turn into something)

## Okay for real

I've just adapted the []() to teach myself the very basics of writing a SlackBot.

I'll turn this into something much smarter soon

## Install

just got clone this, run `npm install` then `node bin/bot`

Go get [the database of Chuck Norris jokes](https://github.com/lmammino/norrisbot/blob/v1.0.0/data/norrisbot.db?raw=true) and put it into the `data/` folder as a file called `norris_jokes.db`

You will need to supply your API key in `BOT_API_KEY`

Based on that key it will attach itself to your Slack team.  Then invite @jobbies to a channel and chat with it.
